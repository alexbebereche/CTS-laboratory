1. The game has an internal chat and players can send messages to others
- we want to filter comments / messages that are not appropriate; those messages will be dropped and not sent
- messages destined for a certain player will be sent in private
- messages sent to @everyone will be broadcast messages for everyone


2. The game client must perform tasks in the background without interfering with the development of the game (without blocking or slowing it down)
- customer data backup - asynk
- receive updates for the forum - asynk
- update 3D models in silent mode (during the game) - asynk (all the asyncs will be objects in the implementation) - will actually execute the command
- a solution must be found through which these tasks can be executed without affecting the execution of the game
